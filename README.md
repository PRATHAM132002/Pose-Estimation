# Pose Estimation Model using MediaPipe

![Pose Estimation](pose_estimation.jpg)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Pose Estimation model using the MediaPipe library. Pose estimation is the task of detecting and tracking key points on a human body, such as joints and landmarks, in images or videos. MediaPipe is an open-source library developed by Google that provides pre-trained models and tools for various computer vision tasks, including pose estimation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- MediaPipe library (`mediapipe`), you can install it using:
  ```
  pip install mediapipe
  ```
  
### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pose-estimation-media-pipe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd pose-estimation-media-pipe
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the `pose_estimation.py` script:
   ```
   python pose_estimation.py
   ```
   
2. The script will use your computer's camera to capture video frames and perform pose estimation on each frame. The estimated key points will be displayed in real-time.

3. Press `Q` to quit the application.

### Customization

You can customize the behavior of the pose estimation model by modifying the parameters in the `pose_estimation.py` script. For example, you can adjust the confidence threshold for key point detection, or you can modify the visual representation of the detected pose on the video frames.
